- [ ] [Speed limits](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits) - Posted speed limit for a given road segment

## Methods

- `snap_to_roads/3`
- `get/2`

## Development

You'll need a [Google API key](https://console.developers.google.com) with
all relevant APIs (see above) enabled. Add your key to the environment as specified above.

Then run tests:

`mix deps.get test`

`mix test`

### Setup credentials

In your `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :google_roads,
  api_key: "your_api_key"
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_roads` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_roads, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```
